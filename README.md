## Introduction

n8n is a powerful workflow automation tool that allows you to connect different applications and automate tasks without writing extensive code. With this project, we aim to enhance n8n's capabilities by introducing automatic scaling for workers based on the workload. This is particularly useful for applications that experience variable traffic, ensuring that resources are used efficiently.

## Features

- **Automatic Worker Scaling**: Adjust the number of workers based on the current workload to optimize resource usage.
- **Queue Mode**: Process tasks in a queue, allowing for better management of high-volume tasks.
- **Puppeteer Integration**: Use Puppeteer for headless browser automation, enabling web scraping and other browser-based tasks.
- **Easy Setup**: Get started quickly with straightforward installation and configuration steps.
- **Robust Performance**: Designed to handle large workloads without compromising on speed or reliability.

## Getting Started

To get started with n8n Autoscaling, follow these steps to set up your environment. Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites before proceeding.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Basic understanding of n8n and workflow automation

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TUSHAR-RGB-bot/n8n-autoscaling.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd n8n-autoscaling
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set your configuration options. Here is an example:

   ```plaintext
   N8N_HOST=localhost
   N8N_PORT=5678
   ```

5. **Run the Application**

   Start the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once you have the application running, you can start creating workflows using the n8n interface. To access the n8n dashboard, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5678`.

### Creating Workflows

1. **Access the Dashboard**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5678`.
2. **Create a New Workflow**: Click on the "New" button to start a new workflow.
3. **Add Nodes**: Use the node panel to add different nodes to your workflow.
4. **Configure Nodes**: Click on each node to configure its settings and connect them as needed.
5. **Execute the Workflow**: Once your workflow is set up, click the "Execute Workflow" button to run it.

### Monitoring Worker Scaling

You can monitor the scaling of workers in real-time through the dashboard. The application will automatically adjust the number of workers based on the queued tasks.
